# .netCore_Angular2_FirebaseAuth
An angular2 template with .netCore and firebase authentication.
I was playing around with Visual Studio SPA Angular template. I decided to use Google Firebase to manage the authentication client side.
This sample shows a basic project with a login, signup, home components.
